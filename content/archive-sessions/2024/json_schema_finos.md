Traditional methods of documenting and managing architectural designs are facing significant limitations. In the Morgan Stanley ecosystem, where complex networks of APIs, gateways, and security mechanisms must seamlessly interact, the need for a more structured approach to architecture has become paramount. James Gough, a Distinguished Engineer and Java Champion, presents FINOS Architecture as Code (CALM), a JSON Schema-based framework that transforms how organizations define and maintain their technical architectures. By using JSON Schema as its foundation, CALM enables architects to precisely specify architectural components - from individual nodes and relationships to broader patterns and controls - in a machine-readable format. The framework introduces a comprehensive tooling ecosystem, including a CLI for validation, visualization, and artifact generation, significantly streamlining the process of ensuring architectural compliance and maintaining documentation. Beyond basic structural elements, CALM incorporates a sophisticated controls system that enforces security, resilience, and observability requirements across the architecture. With the core model approaching its v1 release and ongoing development of features like the VSCode plugin and CALM Hub, CALM represents a significant advancement in architectural governance. Attendees will learn about this innovative approach to architecture as code, its practical applications in enterprise settings, and how it contributes to the broader JSON Schema community.
