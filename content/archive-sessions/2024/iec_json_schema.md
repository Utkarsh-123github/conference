By 2026, every Wind Turbine in the world will be sold with a standardised digital specification sheet, or 'power curve', describing its performance in a wide range of environmental conditions.

Exchange of commercially-sensitive data like power curves hampers progress in the wind industry - there's a high risk of human error in transcribing data, it takes a long time, and finding the right turbine for the right site is painstaking.

At Octue, we've been working with stakeholders across the wind industry and with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) to develop a digital standard, based on JSONSchema, to solve these problems and facilitate much more powerful and effective use of this data (whilst enabling data to be kept commercial-in-confidence).

This talk will look at digitalisation in general within the wind industry, look at the impact on CO2 emissions that this (or other such standards) can have, and look in detail at the process of developing and version-controlling JSONSchema as part of a long and slow standards evolution process.

We'll conclude with some steps we as a community may need to take, in order to foster digitalisation in the engineering sciences.
