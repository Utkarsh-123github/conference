Developers are accustomed to use a range of tooling and practices to improve the quality of their code, ranging from linting, testing, formatting, etc. However, based on our consulting experience (and recent O'Reilly book), developers tend to forget these practices when dealing with schemas. We want to discuss what we privately teach our clients: how to re-adopt these software engineering practices for schemas to increase schema quality to create better OpenAPI and AsyncAPI specifications, and generally make better use of JSON Schema.
