At Octue, we've been developing an app (called 'Strands') to help build, publish and evolve JSONSchema - over time and in a collaborative environment. The build process has been public (with periodic announcements and progress updates made on the JSONSchema discord) and slow (bootstrapped funding only!) but it's finally ready for the community to start using it.

This talk will introduce the Strands app, look back at the build process and key technologies, and extract some lessons (both technical and strategic!) learned from the build. Finally, we'll look at the roadmap ahead, discussing how we plan to reach the feature set that'll make it a really powerful community tool.
